### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Small-drug design using [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) and [Molecular Surface Interaction Fingerprinting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/606202v1)
- Better understand and predict tumor progression using interpretable ML models on scRNA data and metabolic models
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my M.Sc. in Life Sciences Engineering with a strong focus on ML and Computational Biology
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: thom.castiglione@gmail.com
