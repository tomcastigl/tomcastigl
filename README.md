### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
* Small-drug design using [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) and [Molecular Surface Interaction Fingerprinting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/606202v1) in the [LPDI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpdi/) lab.
* Better understand and predict tumor progression using interpretable ML models on scRNA data and metabolic models at the [LCSB](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcsb/) lab
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in my M.Sc. last year in Life Sciences Engineering with a strong focus on ML and Computational Biology at EPFL
